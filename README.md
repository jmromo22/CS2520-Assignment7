The Cannon Game 

Use modular programming and OOP for this assignment. Divide your code into separate, well-defined modules that perform specific tasks or represent specific components of your project. Each module should be self-contained and have a clear interface for interaction with other modules.

In addition to modular programming, apply OOP principles by creating classes that represent the various components of the Cannon Game, such as projectiles, targets, tanks, and bombs. Use inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a clear hierarchy of classes and promote code reusability and maintainability.

Goal of this assignment. 

1.Implement various types of projectiles.
2.Develop several target types with different movement patterns.
3.Transform the cannon into a moving tank.
4.Create "bombs" that will be dropped by targets onto the cannon.
5.Implement multiple cannons that can shoot at each other.
